# Interpretable Clustering with the Distinguishability Criterion

NOTE: **Please check out ([this repository](https://github.com/aturfah/distinguishabilityCriterion)) for a more updated implementation of the methods in this repository**

Implementations of the Distinguishability criterion and scripts to generate the results from the paper Turfah and Wen (2024) "Interpretable Clustering with the Distinguishability Criterion." ([Arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15967)).

## Directory structure

- The implementation of the Distinguishability criterion, the PHM algorithm, and the code to generate the visualizations are in the `code/` directory. [Link to README](code/README.md)
- The scripts to replicate the results from the paper are in the `illustrations/` directory. [Link to README](illustration_code/README.md)
- `.RData` files from the scripts will be written to the `output/` directory. 
- Figures from the scripts will be written into the `plots/` directory.
